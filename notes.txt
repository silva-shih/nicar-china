Thank you Rosyln for this opening. Thank you so much for having me today. 

[2]
I'm the data editor of FTChinese.com based in beijing. Produce data-driving stories and reporting on Taiwan as well.

Previously, I was a business reporter in taiwan, 

has spent two years in New York. So if you have any questions of Taiwanese food and what's up in New York, shoot me a message. 

[3]

So in the following two days, I want to try to give you a little bit     the big picure sense     of data journalism briefly

hope this sounds interesting to you. 


[3]

[4]So, what is data journalism? 

you've heared a lot of discussion recently 

short anwer is..



[5]It started way before you think it did. 

it's a buzzword recently. But is it that new? 


[6]This is map of 19 centry's london. Back then, the cholera outbrake in SOHO area, at first, people assume the disease was spreaded by the air. 

But there's one man, John snow, not the game of thron's jon snow, he knows nothing, 

he used a dot map to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. 


[7] I will leave the history to Roslyn. 

Since it becomes so popular right now, people start to look into the history, tring to find out the root of it and is there any thinking or methods we can adapt it today. 


[8] Simon Rogers, who build up data blog at the guardian in 2012, 2013. Make the public start to get intereting in the power of data narratives. 

[9] And it becomes a global movement right now. There's a official data journalism award for it. 

But have you ever wonderd why people care about it so much now? 

[9]

The "why" shapes "how" you do things.


let's look at a video first.

I'm not sure if any of you have wathced this before. It was produced by google news lab. Talking about how to tell stories with data. 

[9]There are so mucn influential people in this video. 
Propublica's Scot Klien

What have you seen in this video? 

For me, I've seen two things:

[10]
First, Technology advanced. 
We can find stories that we are not be able to find a few years ago, thanks to the techonology.

[11]
Like this story, a blogger who wrote on North korea, using google earth's images to document the ecnomic activities changes in North Korea. 

Google earth turns to be free was only happend in 2015. 

Before that, you have to pay a lot of money to buy those satelite image. 

But now techonology enable to let you find the story like this one. 

[12] Secondly, what I've seen is, data become the force behinde the stories. 

[13]here's the story we've worked on last year. 

On November, Beiijng issued first-ever red-alert on air quality. 

Schools were closed and outdoor construction work was suspended 

realize the only way to decrease pm2.5's level is wind only. 

[14]
There are tones of powerful data journalism cases today, Unfortunatelly, people still misunderstand the beauty of data journalism in some ways. 

[15]

if I don't agree the both statment, so what a data story looks like.

I want to try to give you a little bit of the big picture sense of journalism briefly and open up to any questions you folks have. 

We're able to find stories that I don't think we are able to find a few years ago thanks to the technology

Thank you so much for having me on this meeting. 

My name is Silva, 

I'll take five minutes to introduce myself the works at FTC. I'll appreciate your questions and feedback.

So I'm currently holding the position of data editor at FTC, based in Beijing. I produce data-driven stories and report on Taiwan as well. 

Most of my professional career is in Taiwan. I spent over 5 yrs convering business for Taiwan's local magazine. 




We are a small team with limited resource. Lonely ranger. Keep rolling by yourself. 

But with the help from the programmer of the product team and you, I'm able to work some interesting projects. 

I've categorized my works into three parts. 

#Two sessions 去找英文解釋 

US ambassy 
Red alert policy

Beijing issued First red alert on PM 2.5 last October. According to the officals, once the red alert issued, cars, cargos are resticted on the road. So we dig into the US amabassy's PM 2.5 data and see if the red alert could decrease the density of PM 2.5 

Since the red alert issued in 12 hours, the density is still high. 

And then we compare with the data pf previous yello alert, we found only wind could release the pm 2.5's density.  確認這句

Most of the graphics are sketched on d3 or google spreadsheet and move to illustrator or photoshop to create a png or jpeg file. 

And on the multimedia piece, I've worked with the front-end programmer of our product team to create a one-page template. 


on a normal story page, I cannot paste a javascript code or use iframe. 


Our server is put in Hong kong, the connections is unstable. 

fit into its framework, delay the javascript loading.
